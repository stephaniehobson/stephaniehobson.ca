My name is Stephanie Hobson and I like to make websites everyone can use.

That means thinking about people who use the web differently than I do. Different technologies. Different identities. Different goals. Different languages. Different brains.

So, I like to make sites that are accessible, inclusive, fast, responsive, and robust.

I stumbled into my career in web development while working on a BA in History. I was self taught so I took a 10 month certificate program at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/) to get a piece of paper saying I knew how to do what I already knew how to do.

I started my career as the primary front-end developer for [BCIT.ca](https://www.bcit.ca/). I took some time out to work for an agency. Then I joined Mozilla, first on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) and now on [Mozilla.org](https://www.mozilla.org/). So, I have experience working on both huge old websites and small young ones â€” always as part of a team.
