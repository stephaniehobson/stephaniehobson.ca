My name is Stephanie Hobson and I like to make websites everyone can use.

That means thinking about the people who use the sites I make with different tools and different lives than I have. People with: slower internet connections, older devices, screen readers, switch controls, or high contrast themes. People with: different gender, sexual orientation, skin colour, first language, or brain wiring.

I like to think I'm making the world a better place one byte at a time.

Sometimes I speak on stage about this.
