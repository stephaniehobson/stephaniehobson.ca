I never really knew what I wanted to “be” when I grew up. Career quizzes never knew what to do with my unique combination of creative
and rational thinking. I slowly drifted towards a BA in History, but while I was working on that I made a website and once I did that people kept
asking me to make more of them.

And so I stumbled into a career that had not existed when I was taking the career quizzes. I fell in love with how the semantics of HTML can
increase the reach of content far beyond a single web page. Beyond screens to audio, beyond laptops to watches or TVs, beyond broadband,
beyond English.

I began my career at <a href="https://www.bcit.ca/">BCIT</a>, spent a year at an agency, and then moved into a senior role
 on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">MDN Web Docs</a>.

I now work at <a href="https://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> on the website where people go to download
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Firefox</a>. I contribute to our design system, <a href="https://protocol.mozilla.org/">Protocol</a>,
and I do a lot of random things as needed - from browser add-ons to podcast sites.

At Mozilla I have written primarily HTML and JavaScript and CSS via scss using Django/Jinja2 for templates. Our code review process prioritizes
accessible, localizable, performant, standards-compliant code that uses progressive enhancement to be backwards-compatible.
