Google is having [this contesty thingy](http://www.facebook.com/note_redirect.php?note_id=4253829003&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmail.google.com%2Fmail%2Fhelp%2Fgmail_video.html&h=027cb8a71a9f6bf4ef72960a97f41f13 "http://mail.google.com/mail/help/gmail_video.html"). Which basically requires you to make 10 second (or less) videos of how gMail gets around the world. The idea is for people to get the "Mvelope" from the left to the right side of the screen.

Yesterday after work Alistair filmed videos with my and Kenzie's help, three are up on youtube now:

* [From computer to computer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVsxOxE_F1s)
* [Chin up bars with fancy editing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y98qg9pa87E)
* [Gmail for lunch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jZpK5wYkBM)
