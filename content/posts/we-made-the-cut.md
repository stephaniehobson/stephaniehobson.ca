One of the videos we made [the other day](http://stephaniehobson.ca/2007/08/10/10-seconds-of-my-15-minutes/ "Blog post I made the other day about making gmail videos.") made the cut into the final [Gmail behind the scenes video](http://mail.google.com/mail/help/gmail_video.html).Â  [Alistair](http://www.alistair.com/)'s fancy editing shows the three of us morphing between chin up bars with 1:37 left to go.

A second video of ours was chosen as a featured clip. If you got to the page with the  final [Gmail behind the scenes video](http://mail.google.com/mail/help/gmail_video.html) and scroll down to the map, our multi monitor video appears if you click the Vancouver icon.
