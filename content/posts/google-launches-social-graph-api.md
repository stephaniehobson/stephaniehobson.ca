There were several speakers at WDN who spoke about open social networks, portability and consolidating friend information across applications.  I found the talks interesting and then, while we were still at the conference, Google announced a [Social Graph API](http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/) aiming to do just what we'd been talking about.
