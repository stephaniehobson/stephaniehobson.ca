MacOS won't let me use #dictation because it claims to be disabled in my Screen Time limits

WFT, MacOS disabled an #a11y feature with Screen Time limits?

Help! I can't find it in my screen time limits on MacOS or iOS and I lose at Google.


. On MacOS Ventura it's Screen Time > Content & Privacy > App Restrictions > Allow Siri & Dictation
