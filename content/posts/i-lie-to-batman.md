I was asked the other night who my favourite comic book character is and anyone who knows me would answer without hesitation: Batman. They'd be close.

It's Robin all the way.

Not Dick Grayson,  Jason Todd, or Tim Drake - Robin. You know, that colourful target that swings into action next to the dark knight.

![I lie to Batman](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4004/4194596500_688fdb15ed_o.jpg)I like the idea that Batman needs a little bit of light to balance his darkness. I like the energy, optimism, and ingenuity of a kid fighting in an adult world.

Who's your favourite?
