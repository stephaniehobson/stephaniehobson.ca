Part of my job at BCIT is providing technical support to our content publishing community.  These are the people who provide the text to fill the templates we make and keep that text up to date.  Most of them aren't web developers and are a little intimidated by the idea of working on the website.

Forty percent of our job is providing encouragement.  "Don't worry, it won't go up on the website until we release it so you can play around all you want." "We can always undo the changes if you think you've made a mistake."  I get my best compliments from these kinds of support calls.

This morning on of our clients told me, "You've made me feel so much better about all this now, I'm so glad you called.  What a great way to start a Monday."

What a great way to start a Monday :)
