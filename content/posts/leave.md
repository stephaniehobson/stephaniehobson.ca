I'm taking a one year leave of absence from my job at BCIT beginning June 1<sup>st</sup>, 2012.

Right now it kind of feels like I'm doing this because I'm crazy.

I'm really doing it because there's stuff I want to do.

I want to build something cool. I want to learn something new. I want to live in London. I want to live in San Francisco. I want to hang out with the dear friends who live in each city who I have been apart from for way to long. I want to get to know the friends that I've made in my travels but never lived near.

Along the way I'd going to have to do a bit of work. Contract/sub-contract work I can do remotely while I'm traveling or job offers in San Francisco and London that will help me with the paperwork to work there.

Work that will let me do what I do really well<sup>[1](#one)</sup>, work that will let me do things I enjoy but don't do enough of<sup>[2](#two)</sup>, and work that will give me a chance to learn what I don't do at all yet<sup>[3](#three)</sup>.

1. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, brainstorming and problem solving.
1. Responsive design, user experience testing, information architecture, interface design.
1. SVG, SASS, ePub.

I'm also looking for cheap places to say - friend of a friends who need house sitters or subletters, empty guest rooms and comfy couches. In London or Brighton in Aug and Sept and San Francisco or Berkeley from Oct-Dec.

If you have some work, a place to stay, or some advice for me I can be contacted on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/stephaniehobsonca), or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/stephaniehobson).
