Some quick notes and links for the talk I gave at [WordCamp Vancouver](https://vancouver.wordcamp.org/2015/session/debugging-css/) about Debugging CSS.

**Edit**: You can now watch a recording of [Debugging CSS](http://wordpress.tv/2015/10/02/stephanie-hobson-debugging-css/). Spot the three projector failures!

## Steps

1.  Is the HTML valid?
2.  Is the CSS valid?
3.  Is the right CSS being applied?

    1.  Is what you typed being applied?
    2.  Is other stuff being applied?
    3.  Is what's being applied right?
4.  Does CSS support what youâ€™re doing?
5.  Does the browser support it?
6.  Can you isolate the problem?
7.  Ask for help
