There's a few different versions of my talk floating around now. I'm really excited and humbled to hear that people have been making changes to the way the work in response to something I said.

The most detailed (and longest) version of my talk is available to watch on [Wordpress TV](http://wordpress.tv/2014/09/02/stephanie-hobson-accessibility-with-css-making-websites-better-for-everyone/).

My first slide deck and links to the resources I recommend are part of [an earlier blog post](http://stephaniehobson.ca/2014/05/14/accessibility-with-css-making-websites-better-for-everyone/).

In the most recent version of my talk I used a demo of a fictional hosting company's server status page. Follow these thinks to see the [bad](http://stephaniehobson.ca/demos/hosting_bad.html) and [good](http://stephaniehobson.ca/demos/hosting_good.html) examples and I encourage you to compare the two right now using some assistive technology, or at the very least, using your nose or elbow on your mouse or trackpad.
