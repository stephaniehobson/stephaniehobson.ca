Know how IE and FF display list-style-image bullets at two different heights and it drives us all nuts?

![](/bulletfix/compare_default.gif)

Did you know it was possible to use vertical-align on any inline element? Did you know that first-line is an inline element?

If you're working on displaying the bullets at the same height, [this might be the fix for you](/bulletfix/).
