I [recently spoke at #a11yTOConf](http://conf.a11yto.com/talks#writingForEveryReader), a conference by the organizers of the regular [a11yTO meet-up](https://www.meetup.com/a11yTO/). The organizers put together a great line up of speakers. It was the first #a11yTOConf but I hope it won't be the last!

Here are [my slides for Writing for Every Reader](https://www.slideshare.net/stephaniehobson/writing-for-every-reader/).

### Resources I mentioned:

* [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/), the app that helps improve the readability of your content.
* [BeeLine Reader](http://beelinereader.com/), the browser plugin for dyslexics.

### Articles that were helpful to me:

* [Cognitive Disabilities](http://webaim.org/articles/cognitive/), an introduction by WebAIM.
* [Dyslexia and Typography](http://csskarma.com/blog/dyslexia-typography)
* [Fonts don't matter](https://axesslab.com/fonts-dont-matter/)

### More on accessibility:

* [Selfish Accessibility](http://adrianroselli.com/2017/06/slides-from-wordcamp-europe.html) by Adrian Roselli got mentioned in a few different talks. It's well worth watching.
