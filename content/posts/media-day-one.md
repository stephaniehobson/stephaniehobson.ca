One day I'd like to be able to make the same kind of contribution to the web design world that these speakers have.  Trying to find a way to do that is as intimidating as the idea of writing a Master's thesis.  How does one come up with new ideas?

The speakers have all been excellent so far.  I always need a few days to process information though so I don't have much to say at this point.

A few sessions feel like the same information I got at WDN which makes me question just how many of these conferences one needs to go to in a year and makes me feel better about the fact that I won't be able to attend [An Event Apart](http://www.aneventapart.com/events/seattle07/), mind you I haven't heard most of their speakers...  Are conferences addictive?  Either way I'm out of funding sources and would have to pay for that one myself.  Since I'm on the market for a new computer that's not likely.
