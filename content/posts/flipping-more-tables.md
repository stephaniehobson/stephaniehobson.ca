A few weeks ago I gave my talk on displaying data tables on small screens at [Cascadia Fest](http://2016.cascadiafest.org/). Which is a super awesome 3 days conference in the Pacific North West focusing on CSS and JavaScript (Browser and Server side!)

The video of my talk has been posted:

And [my slides are available here](http://www.slideshare.net/stephaniehobson/flipping-tables-displaying-data-on-small-screens-201608).
