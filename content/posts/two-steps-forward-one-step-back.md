Tuesday I was a guest speaker at Mrs.A's gifted class.  She's teaching a group of 9-12 year olds web design and asked if I'd come in an talk for an afternoon.

So I spent 30 minutes talking to them about the basics of user centred design and how the internet works.  Then I helped them trouble shoot their table based layouts and font tags.
