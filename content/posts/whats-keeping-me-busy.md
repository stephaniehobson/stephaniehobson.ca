Well, outside of my [day job](http://www.bcit.ca/facultystaff/bios/1431805) I'm:

* making my Mum a [website](http://barbhobson.ca)
* moving hosting servers for [digitalphoenix.ca](http://digitalphoenix.ca)
* learning cgi so I can create an auto generated thank you message for [HOPE](http://www.hope-international.com)'s donors
* taking [Mandarin](http://www.bcit.ca/study/courses/cint1110) (what was I thinking?)
