In the spirit of [Jeremy Keith's post](https://adactio.com/journal/1449), here's 8 random things I see about me:

1. Black queen carved like Raven.
2. Small brass Buddha.
3. Wind up penguin.
4. iPhone.
5. Microformats pocket cheat sheet.
6. Salt.
7. 8.5 x 11 print out of the gMail "mvelope".
8. Label from a Christmas present: "To Steph Love, Joel, Jim & Mrs. A."

You're it.
