In the spirit of [Jeremy Keith's post](http://adactio.com/journal/1449), here's 8 random things I see about me:

1.  Black queen carved like Raven.
2.  Small brass Buddha.
3.  Wind up penguin.
4.  iPhone.
5.  Microformats pocket cheat sheet.
6.  Salt.
7.  8.5 x 11 print out of the gMail "mvelope".
8.  Label from a Christmas present: "To Steph Love, Joel, Jim & Mrs. A."

You're it.
