I was very pleased to be invited back to [Style and Class](http://styleandclass.ca/events/2016/coding-mentorship-data/) to give a talk about making data tables responsive. Style and Class is a great Vancouver meet-up I can't recommend enough.

Here are my slides, though the video and animated gifs don't play :(
