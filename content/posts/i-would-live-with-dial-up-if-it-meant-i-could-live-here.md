One of my bestest friends lives in the middle of no where.  High speed internet has not yet come to this island so I'm on dial up today, which is leading to interesting discoveries.

For example, IE6 loads images in the html before it loads background images from the CSS. Very interesting.

Also, turning off the images is not that easy.  I wonder how true the assertion that people with dial up turn them off is.

Bonne Annee!
