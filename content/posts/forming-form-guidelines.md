Who knew web design could be so... academic?

Since I got back from @media I've been hard at work on a set of guidelines which ideally will one day guide the interaction and styling of all forms on the myriad of BCIT web applications though right now will only be applied to anything in the 'public web' look and feel.  I don't think I've done this much research since I finished university.

Here's a bit more information on my quibble with FireFox:[ the bug report and ensuing argument](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=269908).  Some one who knows what they're doing should probably read the CSS3 proposals to see if this can be avoided in the future.
Also, sadly, I'm down to my last two chocolates from See's in San Francisco.
