I wish I could filter my feeds like I do my email, marking the news items in my web comic feeds as read automatically and blocking (deleting? marking as read?) feeds originating at certain URLs (some of my friends have different... taste than I do... repeatedly).

I also wish I could share my feeds with different audiences in mind.  Right now what I share is pretty bland because my clients, friends, and family all see it.  I can't export only fun shared items to my Facebook profile and only web related shared items to my blog everything I share goes everywhere.

I used to wish I could use the handy bookmarklets to page through my items and have a handy way to share but they solved that with the notes bookmarklet.

That said, I live in Reader these days, I check it as much as I do my email!
