I am, for the most part, self taught when it comes to HTML and CSS.  I've take a few courses to get a piece of paper that says I can do what I say I can do but learned very little from them.

I spotted this little CSS tidbit in a presenter's code at the [Web Directions North](http://north.webdirections.org) conference a few weeks ago and now I'm wondering if this is the sort of thing I missed out on by being self taught:

```
table {
        border-collapse: collapse;
    }
```

There are quite a few tables I've designed where this would have been very useful.
