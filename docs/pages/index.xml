&lt;p&gt;My name is Stephanie Hobson and I like to make websites everyone can use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means thinking about people who use the web differently than I do. Different technologies. Different identities. Different goals. Different languages. Different brains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I like to make sites that are accessible, inclusive, fast, responsive, and robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stumbled into my career in web development while working on a BA in History. I was self taught so I took a 10 month certificate program at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ubc.ca/&#34;&gt;UBC&lt;/a&gt; to get a piece of paper saying I knew how to do what I already knew how to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my career as the primary front-end developer for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bcit.ca/&#34;&gt;BCIT.ca&lt;/a&gt;. I took some time out to work for an agency. Then I joined Mozilla, first on &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/&#34;&gt;MDN&lt;/a&gt; and now on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mozilla.org/&#34;&gt;Mozilla.org&lt;/a&gt;. So, I have experience working on both huge old websites and small young ones â€” always as part of a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Crashing Apple products is my crummy super power. Bad spelling is my signature move. --&gt;

&lt;!-- it ends abruptly --&gt;
