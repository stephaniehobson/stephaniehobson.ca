        <p>A few of the people I follow on Twitter lately have made blog posts or tweets about their followers trying to tell them how to tweet. They&rsquo;ve all been asked to stop Twittering personal stuff and keep providing free good advice and the response has been, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t like it, don&rsquo;t follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I just want to go on the record and say I <em>like</em> the personal tweets.</p>
<p>I like knowing that despite their mega awesome coding skills they still have problems with clients.</p>
<p>I like knowing that while working on that beautiful design they spent an hour moving something 2 pixels to the left and then 2 pixels to the right, and then 2 pixels to the left..</p>
<p>I like knowing that they still get nervous about giving presentations, lie awake at night wondering which tag would be more semantic, over dose on caffeine or have a sushi addiction.</p>
<p>I like knowing that despite their commitment to user experience design, web standards, and innovation, they all go home at the end of the day to people and things they think are more important than their work - and those aren&rsquo;t always going the way they want either.</p>
<p>I like knowing that they&rsquo;re human, because it makes it okay for me to be human too.</p>
