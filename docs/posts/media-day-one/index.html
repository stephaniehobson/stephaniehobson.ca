        <p>One day I&rsquo;d like to be able to make the same kind of contribution to the web design world that these speakers have.  Trying to find a way to do that is as intimidating as the idea of writing a Master&rsquo;s thesis.  How does one come up with new ideas?</p>

<p>The speakers have all been excellent so far.  I always need a few days to process information though so I don&rsquo;t have much to say at this point.</p>

<p>A few sessions feel like the same information I got at WDN which makes me question just how many of these conferences one needs to go to in a year and makes me feel better about the fact that I won&rsquo;t be able to attend <a href="http://www.aneventapart.com/events/seattle07/">An Event Apart</a>, mind you I haven&rsquo;t heard most of their speakers&hellip;  Are conferences addictive?  Either way I&rsquo;m out of funding sources and would have to pay for that one myself.  Since I&rsquo;m on the market for a new computer that&rsquo;s not likely.</p>
