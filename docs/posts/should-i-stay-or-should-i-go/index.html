        <p>What should a personal website look like? What should it be for? Am I a person or a business? And what if the latest trend is for your business to be human. Stephaniehobson.ca was supposed to be a personal blog for business stuff but that&rsquo;s, well, <em>boring</em> for me and for you.  So I&rsquo;m thinking of re-doing it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to use this site to bring together all my activities from around the web in one place. Yeah, I know, I always have big plans, but this time I have a deadline (I hope)! I would like it done before I attend @media 2009.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m stalled on starting because I&rsquo;m caught in a debate between leaving the other sites as the authoritative source and trying to make local copies of everything in case those other sources disappear (yes I kept my bookmarks on magnolia, how did you know?).</p>

<p>The public vs private nature of this space is also a bit of a conundrum. My business contacts and potential employers <em>will</em> see this space first if they Google me.  This is my first impression, what does it say about me if I&rsquo;ve been listening to ABBA and bookmarking lol cats? (Yeah, okay, I could be worse.)</p>
