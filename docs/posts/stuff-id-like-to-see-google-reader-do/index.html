Right now what I share is pretty bland because my clients, friends, and family all see it. I can&rsquo;t export only fun shared items to my Facebook profile and only web related shared items to my blog everything I share goes everywhere.<p>I used to wish I could use the handy bookmarklets to page through my items and have a handy way to share but they solved that with the notes bookmarklet.<p>That said, I live in Reader these days, I check it as much as I do my email!</div></article></main><footer class=footer><nav class=footer-nav><a href=/about/>About</a> ‚ÅÉ <a href=/year/>Archives</a></nav><p class=footer-copy>&copy; Stephanie Hobson 2007- 2018</footer></body></html>
