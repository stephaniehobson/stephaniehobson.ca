        <p>Macs have always struck me as more of a religion than an operating system. A family friend and I have a long history of a friendly Mac vs Windows rivalry.  He&rsquo;s the Mac evangelist and I was, well, I wasn&rsquo;t a Windows evangelist but I guess I played the part of a disbeliever.</p>
<p>At some point in 2004 he finally won the argument and I promised my next computer would be a Mac.  But then I got cold feet and I signed up for a course that required I have a Windows machine and I bought a some assembly required Windows box from one of those cheep no name computer stores that come and go over night.  This particular store had been recommended to me a couple times and had stuck around for 5 or 6 years so I figured it was fairly reputable.</p>
<p>A year later the Windows box self destructed.  First I bought a new power supply, then a new fan, then new memory, then a new mother board and finally I stopped short of replacing the hard drive and just pronounced the damn thing dead.</p>
<p>Out of excuses to not buy a Mac and very mad at my last Windows machine. I rented a Mac one for a week to see if I could live with it and decided, at the very lest, the whole command vs control thing would not drive me crazy.  Once I discovered I got educational pricing (the job would suck if it wasn&rsquo;t for the benefits!) I couldn&rsquo;t even argue with the price.  At the very worst I could wipe the hard drive, install Windows, and pretend I never bought a Mac.  Apple also has a very articulate <a href="http://www.apple.com/environment/">environmental policy</a> which doesn&rsquo;t hurt at all.</p>
<p>I bought a 15&quot; Mac Book Pro.</p>
<p>The first week I had it there were a couple times I desperately wanted my money back but after two and a half weeks these are my thoughts:</p>
<p><strong>Text smoothing</strong></p>
<p>As screen technology evolves I&rsquo;m sure it won&rsquo;t matter but right now with this screen on this computer I miss <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/06/12.html">the way Windows renders text</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Work flow</strong></p>
<p>Work flow is the thing that has bothered me the most about switching.  I find I lose windows other other windows and occasionally have to minimize things to the dock one at a time to find them again.  Then I have to un-minimize them because you can&rsquo;t alt-tab to things minimized to the dock.</p>
<p>I really can&rsquo;t make effective use of dual monitors any more because the menu bar stays on the main screen no matter what and tool bars and pallets have to be moved individually.</p>
<p>I also dislike the way applications just pile up.  Every now and then I go to click on a pallet or a scroll bar and suddenly I&rsquo;m an another application.</p>
<p><strong>Learning an new operating system</strong></p>
<p>Switching from Windows XP to OS X was as easy as switching from Windows 98 to Windows XP.  And, lets face it, even Windows users are going have to learn a new operating system when they buy their next computer and just cuz it&rsquo;s pretty doesn&rsquo;t mean Vista is going to be easy to use.</p>
<p><strong>Running Windows</strong></p>
<p>Running windows hasn&rsquo;t been a problem.  I&rsquo;m playing with Parallels and I&rsquo;m going to give VM Ware a go before I decide on which to use but I&rsquo;ll be happy with Parallels.</p>
<p><strong>Buying new everything</strong></p>
<p>When I bought the Adobe creative suite for Windows apparently it came with licenses for Mac versions as well.  Suite.  Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t seem to locate CS2 versions of any of the Adobe stuff but I&rsquo;m happily running all the Macromedia stuff in OS X and the Adobe stuff in Windows for now.</p>
<p>As for other software, hurray for educational pricing.</p>
<p><strong>iPhoto Booth</strong></p>
<p>Damn this is sheer <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=36632&amp;l=f6c55&amp;id=881350410" title="Facebook albumn of photos taken with iPhoto Booth.">dumb fun</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Quicksilver</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> looks like it could be the coolest thing ever, but it needs to be customized to be used to it&rsquo;s full potential and I&rsquo;ve found the basic documentation to be kind of sparse.  The basic idea of being able to do any task ever with a keyboard short cut is very appealing.  I am all about not having to use the mouse.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>
<p>When I told my Mum that I was buying a Mac the first thing she did was seek assurances that I wouldn&rsquo;t become an Mac evangelist like our family friend.  I don&rsquo;t want my money back but I don&rsquo;t think Mum has anything to worry about just yet.</p>
