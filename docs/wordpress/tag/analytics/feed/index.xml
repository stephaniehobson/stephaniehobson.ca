Many of us use Google Analytics (GA) or similar third-party services to keep track of how people interact with our websites; telling us things like when people visit and what they click. This data can help us make important decisions, such as when to schedule maintenance or if a feature can be removed.
Because these services are installed on multiple websites these third-parties can collect a lot of information about people as they move around the internet.</description>

      <description>Google Tag Manager (GTM) is still pretty new as I write this. Stuff is still changing so I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to focus on techniques rather than step by step instructions (but I have some of those too).
What is GTM You include a code snippet from GTM on your site which, among other things, includes a file. Then you use the GTM interface to configure what goes in that file.</description>
