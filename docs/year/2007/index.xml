      <description>One of my bestest friends lives in the middle of no where. High speed internet has not yet come to this island so I&amp;rsquo;m on dial up today, which is leading to interesting discoveries.
For example, IE6 loads images in the html before it loads background images from the CSS. Very interesting.
Also, turning off the images is not that easy. I wonder how true the assertion that people with dial up turn them off is.</description>

      <title>CSS bug in IE 6 with: .class a:hover element</title>
      <link>https://stephaniehobson.ca/posts/css-bug-in-ie-6-with-class-ahover-element/</link>

      <guid>https://stephaniehobson.ca/posts/css-bug-in-ie-6-with-class-ahover-element/</guid>
      <description>This bug seems to apply to styling elements under a class or id within a link on hover. Stuff like .class a:hover span{} or #id a:hover strong{}. The solution is to define a property on the parent link .class a:hover{} that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been declared anywhere else in your CSS, like a text indent of 0 or something.
All the work for the solution was done by Tanfa, who wrote an article on IE Pure CSS Pop Ups Bug, I just thought it was worth mentioning that this bug can be generalized to more than the CSS menus.</description>

      <description>One of the videos we made the other day made the cut into the final Gmail behind the scenes video. Alistair&amp;rsquo;s fancy editing shows the three of us morphing between chin up bars with 1:37 left to go.
A second video of ours was chosen as a featured clip. If you got to the page with the final Gmail behind the scenes video and scroll down to the map, our multi monitor video appears if you click the Vancouver icon.</description>

      <description>When I went on vacation a few weeks ago I got a little behind on my RSS feeds. I&amp;rsquo;d manage to whittle it down from almost 200 unread articles to about 40 over the course of the month, while keeping up with all the new articles, and I was feeling pretty good about it when I went to switch my view from new items to all items and hit &amp;ldquo;mark all as read&amp;rdquo; instead.</description>

      <description>Google is having this contesty thingy. Which basically requires you to make 10 second (or less) videos of how gMail gets around the world. The idea is for people to get the &amp;ldquo;Mvelope&amp;rdquo; from the left to the right side of the screen.
Yesterday after work Alistair filmed videos with my and Kenzie&amp;rsquo;s help, three are up on youtube now:

      <description>Part of my job at BCIT is providing technical support to our content publishing community. These are the people who provide the text to fill the templates we make and keep that text up to date. Most of them aren&amp;rsquo;t web developers and are a little intimidated by the idea of working on the website.
Forty percent of our job is providing encouragement. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, it won&amp;rsquo;t go up on the website until we release it so you can play around all you want.</description>

      <description>Has anyone else noticed a bunch of really old HTML coding tutorials at the top of their search results when searching for answers to HTML coding questions lately?
I was trying to find out if legend was a required tag in fieldset and I got a tutorial that said not to use legend because Netscape 4 doesn&amp;rsquo;t support it yet but should soon!</description>

      <description>Who knew web design could be so&amp;hellip; academic?
Since I got back from @media I&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work on a set of guidelines which ideally will one day guide the interaction and styling of all forms on the myriad of BCIT web applications though right now will only be applied to anything in the &amp;lsquo;public web&amp;rsquo; look and feel. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve done this much research since I finished university.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a list consisting of all the websites and books recommended during the course of the conference that interested me enough to warrant writing down for later evaluation (including links to most of the presentations):&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>One day I&amp;rsquo;d like to be able to make the same kind of contribution to the web design world that these speakers have. Trying to find a way to do that is as intimidating as the idea of writing a Master&amp;rsquo;s thesis. How does one come up with new ideas?
The speakers have all been excellent so far. I always need a few days to process information though so I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to say at this point.</description>

      <description>I was in Winnipeg speaking at the CADE/AMTECH Conference last week. The weather was beautiful and I saw an excellent hockey game in which the Manitoba Moose (the Vancouver Canucks&amp;rsquo; farm team) played spectacularly only to to be knocked out of the AHL playoffs in a very Canucks way (up 2-0 at the end of the first, lost 2-3 in OT).
As part of the Technology Enabled Knowledge (TEK) initiative at BCIT Danny Catt, one of the faculty, was sponsored to take a trip around South America and Antarctica studying local research and responses to sustainability and environmental issues.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to seriously redo some of the HTML and CSS behind the BCIT site since I came on board here almost a year ago.
Well, I get my wish. We&amp;rsquo;re going to take some baby steps towards semantic HTML and CSS (POSH if you like) and despite my aversion to being in charge, I&amp;rsquo;m leading the project.
As a first step I&amp;rsquo;m trying to write a CSS coding style guide.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d post my summary of Web Directions North that I distributed to the department a month or so after the conference.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to write a more technical and personal review of it but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear to me that if I haven&amp;rsquo;t done it by now, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to get around to doing it :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I just finished my first micoformatted page! When I was writing the information page for HOPE&amp;rsquo;s spring dinners I coded all the dinners as events and the organizers as hcards :) I did work with Brandon to re-do the BCIT Contacts application to use microformats but he did most of the coding on that project. This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve done it myself.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually tell anyone at HOPE that I&amp;rsquo;d done it that way since it doesn&amp;rsquo;t effect the way the page looks and I figure they&amp;rsquo;ll discover it for themselves if it&amp;rsquo;s useful to them.</description>

      <description>I keep up on my favorite blogs and web comics by book marking them all in Firefox and then using the &amp;ldquo;open all in tabs&amp;rdquo; option that FireFox so nicely includes to open all the book marks at once. That way I can keep track of which ones I&amp;rsquo;ve read by closing them once I&amp;rsquo;m done :) Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s lazy I know.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to have access to my bookmarks when I&amp;rsquo;m away from my home computer (who doesn&amp;rsquo;t) so I jumped on the del.</description>

      <description>One of the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on at BCIT is Catt-Trax2. The website is for Danny Catt who is traveling through South America and Antarctica exploring conservation and sustainability issues and talking to the people in those regions working with those issues daily. He&amp;rsquo;s taking photos, video, and sound clips of this journey and blogging about his experiences. I helped architect the website and did some design and implementation work on it.</description>

      <description>Vivian is such a great motivator. I&amp;rsquo;m still sorry to see her go.
I just came out of a performance review where Vivian simultaneously told me what a great job I&amp;rsquo;m doing and laid out the changes I need to make to my life to have the world laid out at my feet by the time I&amp;rsquo;m forty.
She said to me that in IT there are kind of two main career paths; one which is super specialized with one specific area of technology and one that sees the big picture and manages.</description>

      <description>All I did was copy the cgi file and change the file name and now it&amp;rsquo;s not encrypting the e-mails it sends any more.
Hm.
Edit: Yup, the problem was that I changed the name.
Edit 07-03-26: I&amp;rsquo;ve also discovered that cgi files are not encoded using windows text format so opening them in notepad and saving them again is enough to destroy all functionality.</description>

      <description>I am, for the most part, self taught when it comes to HTML and CSS. I&amp;rsquo;ve take a few courses to get a piece of paper that says I can do what I say I can do but learned very little from them.
I spotted this little CSS tidbit in a presenter&amp;rsquo;s code at the Web Directions North conference a few weeks ago and now I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if this is the sort of thing I missed out on by being self taught:</description>
