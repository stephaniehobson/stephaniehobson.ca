As a front-end developer at Mozilla, I end up working on big sites that have been around for a long time. There are a lot of interesting challenges when working with legacy code at a large scale, but rebuilding from scratch usually isn’t an option.
The View Source Conference website, on the other hand, is a small site. So when we decided to move away from WordPress, we had the chance to start fresh.</description>

Kuma, the code that produces the MDN site, is a weird mix of the old and the new. MDN turned ten in 2015 and there’s still code and content around from those very first days. When I sat down to start coding the current redesign, the first thing I did was remove the last few traces of the last redesign. In contrast, we have a cutting-edge audience: 92% of our users have a browser with CSS grid support!</description>

We enabled HTTP/2 on MDN&amp;rsquo;s CDN.
We didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything to optimize for HTTP/2, we just enabled it.
We&amp;rsquo;re seeing performance improvements.
You don&amp;rsquo;t have to get ready before you start using HTTP/2 While doing research to see if turning it on without doing any optimizations was a good idea I read things like:
 &amp;ldquo;It also means that all of those HTTP1 performance techniques are harmful.</description>

Many of us use Google Analytics (GA) or similar third-party services to keep track of how people interact with our websites; telling us things like when people visit and what they click. This data can help us make important decisions, such as when to schedule maintenance or if a feature can be removed.
Because these services are installed on multiple websites these third-parties can collect a lot of information about people as they move around the internet.</description>
