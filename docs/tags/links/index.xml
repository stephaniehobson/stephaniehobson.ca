      <description>Last week, because working at Mozilla is awesome, I got to attend An Event Apart Austin, the conference put on by the A List Apart organization. It&amp;rsquo;s consistently one of the highest quality conferences for front-end/user experience talks. I try to go every other year.
The conference was great and the organizers did a good job making the speakers accessible, sitting them with us at lunch and keeping them around for the mixer.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago Smashing Conference came to Whistler. This caliber of conference comes to Canada infrequently so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t not go ;)
The conference As good as I hoped it would be. A mix of strategy and near future technology examples. My Favourite Talk  Building the next-generation of theguardian.com, by Patrick Hamann Slides The Guardian takes a true mobile-first, progressive-enhancement approach to serving their content. I was super excited to see how quickly and cleanly an article loads.</description>

Jason used it as an example of how print can be very cool looking but the web is missing that pizzaz for individual articles. NY Times articles about Trolls Don&amp;rsquo;t feed the trolls.

      <description>Just like last year I thought I&amp;rsquo;d post my summary of the conference that I distributed to my department. If I have any regular readers at all, it&amp;rsquo;s probably a little too general to do you any good but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to answer questions:
Web Directions North is an internationally respected conference for web professionals. This yearâ€™s conference was a good high level overview of the new trends and technologies online.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a list consisting of all the websites and books recommended during the course of the conference that interested me enough to warrant writing down for later evaluation (including links to most of the presentations):&lt;/p&gt;
