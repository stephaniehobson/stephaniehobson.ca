	<h2>Polygons</h2>
	<h3>The problem</h3>
	<p>Creating boxes that are not rectangular.</p>
	<img src="css3_polygon.jpg" alt="Picture of a navigation menu with slanted edges">
	
	<h3>A possible solution:</h3>
	<p>Each corner of a box could be positioned relative to where it would be placed as a square.  A point half way along the sides of the boxes could be used as an anchor to determine the angles.</p>

	<code>
		.lipsum{<br>
		corner-top-right:left -50%;<br>
		corner-bottom-right:left -50%;<br>
		corner-content-clipping: ;<br>
		}<br><br>
		.nav li{<br>
		corner-top-right: left 3px;<br>
		corner-bottom-right: left -3px; | corner-bottom-right: right 3px;<br>
		}<br>
	</code>

	<div style="background-color:#f00">more control over form elements - including scroll bars
	
	A way to target different rendering engines for specific things - because let's face it we're always going to need to do hacks
	place divs inside other divs #div{position:#otherdiv top left;} - like layout lets you place in slots
	
	</div>
	
		
	<div style="background-color:#F00">
		corner padding (may be able to achieve with rounded corners that aren't rounded) - can we make dimonds with border-radius? (sounds like it clips content instead of padding it) - diagonal borders /link/link/
		Ability to define non-straight edges and have text wrap around them
		Sizing elements relative to other ones on the page
		.div{height:#otherdiv;}
	</div>

		A second post to follow up on the layout/slots module.  I saw Andy Clarke demo it at WDN07 and I had serious concerns about the maintainability of the code.  I have to go read the spec before I comment though to make sure my fuzzy memories are accurate.
			 - don't like slots. What if we want to put a new thing in slot b, do we then have to increment cdefghijk?  What about something like z indexs or simply a source order slot:a{#div1, #div3} slot: b{#div2}
			give slots semantic names slot:nav slot:header
			
			for columns - ability to split them at a specific height (like screen height) to avoid up and down scrolling between columsn
