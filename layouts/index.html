{{ define "main" }}

<p>I am a front-end developer. I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to combine content and designs into websites that are fast, easy to use, readable in
    any language, and work on everyone's devices.</p>

    <!--
<p>HTML, CSS, JS, a11y, analytics, performance, design systems, L10N. Accessibility first. I love working with and building design systems. I know websites driven by CMSs and community of content contributors. (Contentful, Wagtail, Jinja, Hugo, Concrete, Wordpress, Drupal, Marqui)</p>

<p>Making accessible websites is so important to me I used to give <a href="/tags/presentation/">conference talks</a> on it.</p>

<p>At Mozilla I have written primarily HTML and Javascript and CSS via scss using Django/Jinja2 for templating. Our code review process prioritizes accessible, localizable, performant, standards-compliant code that uses progressive enhancement to be backwards-compatible.</p>

<p>But it's not all maintaining a 20 year old website. I've written Firefox addons, spoofed Spotify, used static site generators for IRL and View Source. -->
