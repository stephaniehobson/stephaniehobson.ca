- warning on out dated posts ("from before iPhone, from before Chrome, before CSS grid")
- most recent instagram and twitter posts

        - grouped by talk with links to resources, only show most recent slides(or video), dates presented link to Notist
    - portfolio/work
- blurb at end of blog posts introducing myself (comic book inspired? Imagine Eric Meyer is introducing me)
- "read more" buttons specific to content "see the code" "view the slides"
