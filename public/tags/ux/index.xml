      <description>Almost a year ago now the BCIT Bookstore let Web Services know that the e-commerce application they used to manage their online sales was upgrading and asked if we&amp;rsquo;d like to help skin the new site. The department was pretty busy at the time and my manager said we didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to help out but put them in contact with me so I could direct them to the style guide and technical guidelines.</description>

      <description>When I went on vacation a few weeks ago I got a little behind on my RSS feeds. I&amp;rsquo;d manage to whittle it down from almost 200 unread articles to about 40 over the course of the month, while keeping up with all the new articles, and I was feeling pretty good about it when I went to switch my view from new items to all items and hit &amp;ldquo;mark all as read&amp;rdquo; instead.</description>

      <description>Who knew web design could be so&amp;hellip; academic?
Since I got back from @media I&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work on a set of guidelines which ideally will one day guide the interaction and styling of all forms on the myriad of BCIT web applications though right now will only be applied to anything in the &amp;lsquo;public web&amp;rsquo; look and feel.Â I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve done this much research since I finished university.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d post my summary of Web Directions North that I distributed to the department a month or so after the conference.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to write a more technical and personal review of it but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear to me that if I haven&amp;rsquo;t done it by now, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to get around to doing it :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
