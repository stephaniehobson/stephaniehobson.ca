      <description>I have a friend who lives his life in low contrast. He is frequently the inspiration I need to go the extra mile and find an accessible solution to a programing quandary. A few weeks ago I had the good fortune to get to visit him and we cruised around the internet while drinking Rusty Nails so I could walk in his shoes for a bit.
His computer is set up to use one of Windows XP&amp;rsquo;s high contrast colour schemes and he also makes use of IE&amp;rsquo;s ability to override a website&amp;rsquo;s CSS.</description>

      <description>I read John Resig&amp;rsquo;s article Sub-Pixel Problems in CSS a few days ago and found it to very useful information.
And then today I had an &amp;ldquo;ah-ha&amp;rsquo; moment - this this is why I hate coding flexible horizontal navigation menus.</description>
