      <description>I spoke at an HTML5 Code Camp the other day on HTML5 forms because HTML5 forms are cool! They&amp;rsquo;re so cool you can use most of them today anywhere you have a text field to increase functionality for your users!
   HTML5 Forms OF DOOM  from Stephanie Hobson   Sample form.

      <title>CSS Loading Spinner</title>

      <description>I needed a loading spinner for a side project the other day but I was too lazy to steal someone else&amp;rsquo;s off the internet or try to re-learn making an animated GIF so I just coded my own in CSS (CSS is my hammer).
On the bright side it works on any background colour and is a little transparent which is neat. And it&amp;rsquo;s way faster to adjust the colour scheme than an image file would be.</description>

      <title>A style tag counts as a :first-child</title>

      <description>EDIT 2011-09-15: All of this applies to &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; in the body as well.
I have some bad news and a fix (I hesitate to call it good news).
HTML5 introduces a way for us to include &amp;lt;style&amp;gt; elements on the page, we just need to give them an attribute of scoped. So, for example, if you have an SSI included widget you can include the styles in the widget file instead of trying to devise a way to add them to the head.</description>

      <title>FireFox&#39;s buttons are wider than IE or Chrome/Safari&#39;s</title>

      <description>I hate form styling on the best of days. This is a good example of why:
Firefox&amp;rsquo;s buttons are wider than IE&amp;rsquo;s or Webkit&amp;rsquo;s. Why? This little gem in the browser&amp;rsquo;s style sheets:
button::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&amp;quot;reset&amp;quot;]::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&amp;quot;button&amp;quot;]::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&amp;quot;submit&amp;quot;]::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&amp;quot;file&amp;quot;] &amp;gt; input[type=&amp;quot;button&amp;quot;]::-moz-focus-inner { padding: 0px 2px 0px 2px; }  That&amp;rsquo;s right, it&amp;rsquo;s 4px wider. Thank you FireFox.
Fortunately, we can fix it!
button::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&amp;quot;reset&amp;quot;]::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&amp;quot;button&amp;quot;]::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&amp;quot;submit&amp;quot;]::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&amp;quot;file&amp;quot;] &amp;gt; input[type=&amp;quot;button&amp;quot;]::-moz-focus-inner { padding: 0px; }  That was easy :)</description>

      <title>Bullets aligned to the top of the text</title>
      <link>https://stephaniehobson.ca/posts/bullets-alligned-top-text/</link>

      <description>Know how IE and FF display list-style-image bullets at two different heights and it drives us all nuts?
Did you know it was possible to use vertical-align on any inline element? Did you know that first-line is an inline element?
If you&amp;rsquo;re working on displaying the bullets at the same height, this might be the fix for you.</description>

      <title>CSS3 only cover flow</title>

      <description>Nothing teaches me how to do something like a project and I was trying to learn CSS3 so I tried to make a CSS only cover flow.
Some of it works in FireFox but all the cool stuff works best in webkit: here&amp;rsquo;s as far as I got.
Have fun with it :)</description>

      <title>CSS bug in IE 6 with: .class a:hover element</title>
      <link>https://stephaniehobson.ca/posts/css-bug-in-ie-6-with-class-ahover-element/</link>

      <guid>https://stephaniehobson.ca/posts/css-bug-in-ie-6-with-class-ahover-element/</guid>
      <description>This bug seems to apply to styling elements under a class or id within a link on hover. Stuff like .class a:hover span{} or #id a:hover strong{}. The solution is to define a property on the parent link .class a:hover{} that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been declared anywhere else in your CSS, like a text indent of 0 or something.
All the work for the solution was done by Tanfa, who wrote an article on IE Pure CSS Pop Ups Bug, I just thought it was worth mentioning that this bug can be generalized to more than the CSS menus.</description>

      <description>So apparently we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be encoding ampersands when we write them in the href part of anchor tags.

      <description>I am, for the most part, self taught when it comes to HTML and CSS. I&amp;rsquo;ve take a few courses to get a piece of paper that says I can do what I say I can do but learned very little from them.
I spotted this little CSS tidbit in a presenter&amp;rsquo;s code at the Web Directions North conference a few weeks ago and now I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if this is the sort of thing I missed out on by being self taught:</description>
