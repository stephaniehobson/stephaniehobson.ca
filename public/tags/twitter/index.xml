      <description>Twitter is an amazing tool to catch a glimpse of the collective consciousness. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it during the Olympics and I&amp;rsquo;ve been apart of it at conferences like An Event Apart. Jeremy Keith once said that Twitter was the closest he&amp;rsquo;d ever come to feeling as though he&amp;rsquo;s jacked into the Matrix.
Most of us use Twitter to keep in touch with people we know and keep up with things we care about.</description>

      <description>A few of the people I follow on Twitter lately have made blog posts or tweets about their followers trying to tell them how to tweet. They&amp;rsquo;ve all been asked to stop Twittering personal stuff and keep providing free good advice and the response has been, &amp;ldquo;If you don&amp;rsquo;t like it, don&amp;rsquo;t follow.&amp;rdquo;
I just want to go on the record and say I like the personal tweets.
I like knowing that despite their mega awesome coding skills they still have problems with clients.</description>
