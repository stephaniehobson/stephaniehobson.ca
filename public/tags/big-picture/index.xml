      <description>What should a personal website look like? What should it be for? Am I a person or a business? And what if the latest trend is for your business to be human. Stephaniehobson.ca was supposed to be a personal blog for business stuff but that&amp;rsquo;s, well, boring for me and for you. So I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of re-doing it.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to use this site to bring together all my activities from around the web in one place.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d post my summary of Web Directions North that I distributed to the department a month or so after the conference.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to write a more technical and personal review of it but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear to me that if I haven&amp;rsquo;t done it by now, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to get around to doing it :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I just finished my first micoformatted page! When I was writing the information page for HOPE&amp;rsquo;s spring dinners I coded all the dinners as events and the organizers as hcards :) I did work with Brandon to re-do the BCIT Contacts application to use microformats but he did most of the coding on that project. This is the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve done it myself.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually tell anyone at HOPE that I&amp;rsquo;d done it that way since it doesn&amp;rsquo;t effect the way the page looks and I figure they&amp;rsquo;ll discover it for themselves if it&amp;rsquo;s useful to them.</description>

      <description>Vivian is such a great motivator. I&amp;rsquo;m still sorry to see her go.
I just came out of a performance review where Vivian simultaneously told me what a great job I&amp;rsquo;m doing and laid out the changes I need to make to my life to have the world laid out at my feet by the time I&amp;rsquo;m forty.
She said to me that in IT there are kind of two main career paths; one which is super specialized with one specific area of technology and one that sees the big picture and manages.</description>
