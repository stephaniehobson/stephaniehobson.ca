      <description>_Note: If you&amp;rsquo;re following me because you&amp;rsquo;re a code geek, like I am, and you want only my web design related feed and posts they have their own category now. _
I was asked the other night who my favourite comic book character is and anyone who knows me would answer without hesitation: Batman. They&amp;rsquo;d be close.
It&amp;rsquo;s Robin all the way.
Not Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, or Tim Drake - Robin.</description>

      <title>Why I follow my heroes on Twitter</title>

      <description>A few of the people I follow on Twitter lately have made blog posts or tweets about their followers trying to tell them how to tweet. They&amp;rsquo;ve all been asked to stop Twittering personal stuff and keep providing free good advice and the response has been, &amp;ldquo;If you don&amp;rsquo;t like it, don&amp;rsquo;t follow.&amp;rdquo;
I just want to go on the record and say I like the personal tweets.
I like knowing that despite their mega awesome coding skills they still have problems with clients.</description>
