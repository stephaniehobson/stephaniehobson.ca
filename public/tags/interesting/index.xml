      <description>Short answer: it&amp;rsquo;s my thinking style :)

It&amp;rsquo;s one of four learning styles as categorized by Dr. Anthony F. Gregorc. (I totally just Googled that). I first heard about my style from my teacher and friend Cheryl Atwater.</description>

[NY Times articles about Trolls](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1) Don&#39;t feed the trolls. One of the trials of community managers. [Flickr Colouring Contest](http://flickr.com/groups/flickrcolorcontest/) Making lemonaid out or error messages as part of community management.</description>
