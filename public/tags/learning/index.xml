      <description>Tuesday I was a guest speaker at Mrs.A&amp;rsquo;s gifted class. She&amp;rsquo;s teaching a group of 9-12 year olds web design and asked if I&amp;rsquo;d come in an talk for an afternoon.
So I spent 30 minutes talking to them about the basics of user centred design and how the internet works. Then I helped them trouble shoot their table based layouts and font tags.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;From your 77 subscriptions, over the last 30 days you read 809 items&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
 No wonder I don&amp;rsquo;t read any books any more.</description>

      <description>I read John Resig&amp;rsquo;s article Sub-Pixel Problems in CSS a few days ago and found it to very useful information.
And then today I had an &amp;ldquo;ah-ha&amp;rsquo; moment - this this is why I hate coding flexible horizontal navigation menus.</description>

      <description>Macs have always struck me as more of a religion than an operating system. A family friend and I have a long history of a friendly Mac vs Windows rivalry. He&amp;rsquo;s the Mac evangelist and I was, well, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a Windows evangelist but I guess I played the part of a disbeliever.
At some point in 2004 he finally won the argument and I promised my next computer would be a Mac.</description>

      <description>Wow, FireFox does not play nice with styling legends.
FireFox, I&amp;rsquo;m not mad, I&amp;rsquo;m just disappointed.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to seriously redo some of the HTML and CSS behind the BCIT site since I came on board here almost a year ago.
Well, I get my wish. We&amp;rsquo;re going to take some baby steps towards semantic HTML and CSS (POSH if you like) and despite my aversion to being in charge, I&amp;rsquo;m leading the project.
As a first step I&amp;rsquo;m trying to write a CSS coding style guide.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d post my summary of Web Directions North that I distributed to the department a month or so after the conference.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to write a more technical and personal review of it but it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear to me that if I haven&amp;rsquo;t done it by now, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to get around to doing it :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>So apparently we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be encoding ampersands when we write them in the href part of anchor tags.

      <description>Vivian is such a great motivator. I&amp;rsquo;m still sorry to see her go.
I just came out of a performance review where Vivian simultaneously told me what a great job I&amp;rsquo;m doing and laid out the changes I need to make to my life to have the world laid out at my feet by the time I&amp;rsquo;m forty.
She said to me that in IT there are kind of two main career paths; one which is super specialized with one specific area of technology and one that sees the big picture and manages.</description>

      <description>All I did was copy the cgi file and change the file name and now it&amp;rsquo;s not encrypting the e-mails it sends any more.
Hm.
Edit: Yup, the problem was that I changed the name.
Edit 07-03-26: I&amp;rsquo;ve also discovered that cgi files are not encoded using windows text format so opening them in notepad and saving them again is enough to destroy all functionality.</description>

      <description>I am, for the most part, self taught when it comes to HTML and CSS. I&amp;rsquo;ve take a few courses to get a piece of paper that says I can do what I say I can do but learned very little from them.
I spotted this little CSS tidbit in a presenter&amp;rsquo;s code at the Web Directions North conference a few weeks ago and now I&amp;rsquo;m wondering if this is the sort of thing I missed out on by being self taught:</description>
