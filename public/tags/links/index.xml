      <description>Last week, because working at Mozilla is awesome, I got to attend An Event Apart Austin, the conference put on by the A List Apart organization. It&amp;rsquo;s consistently one of the highest quality conferences for front-end/user experience talks. I try to go every other year.
The conference was great and the organizers did a good job making the speakers accessible, sitting them with us at lunch and keeping them around for the mixer.</description>

      <description>[Bobulate](http://bobulate.com/) Can&#39;t remember why it was mentioned but it is about IA and looks interesting. [Wired](http://www.wired.com/) Apparently half the people in the room read it. Jason used it as an example of how print can be very cool looking but the web is missing that pizzaz for individual articles. [NY Times articles about Trolls](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/magazine/03trolls-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1) Don&#39;t feed the trolls. One of the trials of community managers.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a list consisting of all the websites and books recommended during the course of the conference that interested me enough to warrant writing down for later evaluation (including links to most of the presentations):&lt;/p&gt;
