      <description>I spoke at an HTML5 Code Camp the other day on HTML5 forms because HTML5 forms are cool! They&amp;rsquo;re so cool you can use most of them today anywhere you have a text field to increase functionality for your users!
 ** [HTML5 Forms OF DOOM](https://www.slideshare.net/stephaniehobson/html5-forms-of-doom &#34;HTML5 Forms OF DOOM&#34;) ** from **[stephaniehobson](http://www.slideshare.net/stephaniehobson)**  Download the slides.

      <description>EDIT 2011-09-15: All of this applies to &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; in the body as well.
I have some bad news and a fix (I hesitate to call it good news).
HTML5 introduces a way for us to include &amp;lt;style&amp;gt; elements on the page, we just need to give them an attribute of scoped. So, for example, if you have an SSI included widget you can include the styles in the widget file instead of trying to devise a way to add them to the head.</description>

      <title>FireFox&#39;s buttons are wider than IE or Chrome/Safari&#39;s</title>

      <description>I hate form styling on the best of days. This is a good example of why:
Firefox&amp;rsquo;s buttons are wider than IE&amp;rsquo;s or Webkit&amp;rsquo;s. Why? This little gem in the browser&amp;rsquo;s style sheets:
button::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&amp;quot;reset&amp;quot;]::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&amp;quot;button&amp;quot;]::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&amp;quot;submit&amp;quot;]::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&amp;quot;file&amp;quot;] &amp;gt; input[type=&amp;quot;button&amp;quot;]::-moz-focus-inner { padding: 0px 2px 0px 2px; }  That&amp;rsquo;s right, it&amp;rsquo;s 4px wider. Thank you FireFox.
Fortunately, we can fix it!
button::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&amp;quot;reset&amp;quot;]::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&amp;quot;button&amp;quot;]::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&amp;quot;submit&amp;quot;]::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&amp;quot;file&amp;quot;] &amp;gt; input[type=&amp;quot;button&amp;quot;]::-moz-focus-inner { padding: 0px; }  That was easy :)</description>

      <description>Rather than doing one giant redesign and launch, at BCIT, we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing small updates for a while now.
Take our footer for example, I got to update all of them using the CSS a few times and then we decided we wanted to mix up the HTML. Templates and applications were updated with the new code in phases. There were a few different ways the CSS for this could have been managed but I chose to have the old code co-exist with the new in the same style sheet and differentiated the two with IDs (let&amp;rsquo;s say I called them #footer and #fatfooter).</description>

      <description>I have a friend who lives his life in low contrast. He is frequently the inspiration I need to go the extra mile and find an accessible solution to a programing quandary. A few weeks ago I had the good fortune to get to visit him and we cruised around the internet while drinking Rusty Nails so I could walk in his shoes for a bit.
His computer is set up to use one of Windows XP&amp;rsquo;s high contrast colour schemes and he also makes use of IE&amp;rsquo;s ability to override a website&amp;rsquo;s CSS.</description>

      <description>Almost a year ago now the BCIT Bookstore let Web Services know that the e-commerce application they used to manage their online sales was upgrading and asked if we&amp;rsquo;d like to help skin the new site. The department was pretty busy at the time and my manager said we didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to help out but put them in contact with me so I could direct them to the style guide and technical guidelines.</description>

      <description>Tuesday I was a guest speaker at Mrs.A&amp;rsquo;s gifted class. She&amp;rsquo;s teaching a group of 9-12 year olds web design and asked if I&amp;rsquo;d come in an talk for an afternoon.
So I spent 30 minutes talking to them about the basics of user centred design and how the internet works. Then I helped them trouble shoot their table based layouts and font tags.</description>

      <description>Just like last year I thought I&amp;rsquo;d post my summary of the conference that I distributed to my department. If I have any regular readers at all, it&amp;rsquo;s probably a little too general to do you any good but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to answer questions:
Web Directions North is an internationally respected conference for web professionals. This yearâ€™s conference was a good high level overview of the new trends and technologies online.</description>

      <description>I read John Resig&amp;rsquo;s article Sub-Pixel Problems in CSS a few days ago and found it to very useful information.
And then today I had an &amp;ldquo;ah-ha&amp;rsquo; moment - this this is why I hate coding flexible horizontal navigation menus.</description>
