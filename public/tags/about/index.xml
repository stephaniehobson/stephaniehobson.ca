      <description>Short answer: it&amp;rsquo;s my thinking style :)
It means I enjoy theory, logic, precision and abstract thought and that I learn best through lecture, independent research, and following procedures. This means I love web design but makes my blog very, very boring.
It&amp;rsquo;s one of four learning styles as categorized by Dr. Anthony F. Gregorc. (I totally just Googled that). I first heard about my style from my teacher and friend Cheryl Atwater.</description>

      <description>What should a personal website look like? What should it be for? Am I a person or a business? And what if the latest trend is for your business to be human. Stephaniehobson.ca was supposed to be a personal blog for business stuff but that&amp;rsquo;s, well, boring for me and for you. So I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of re-doing it.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to use this site to bring together all my activities from around the web in one place.</description>
