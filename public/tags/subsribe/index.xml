      <description>I wish I could filter my feeds like I do my email, marking the news items in my web comic feeds as read automatically and blocking (deleting? marking as read?) feeds originating at certain URLs (some of my friends have different&amp;hellip; taste than I do&amp;hellip; repeatedly).
I also wish I could share my feeds with different audiences in mind. Right now what I share is pretty bland because my clients, friends, and family all see it.</description>
