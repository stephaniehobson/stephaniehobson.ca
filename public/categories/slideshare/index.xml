      <description>I recently spoke at #a11yTOConf, a conference by the organizers of the regular a11yTO meet-up. The organizers put together a great line up of speakers. It was the first #a11yTOConf but I hope it won&amp;rsquo;t be the last!
Here are my slides for Writing for Every Reader.
Resources I mentioned:  Hemingway App, the app that helps improve the readability of your content. BeeLine Reader, the browser plugin for dyslexics.</description>
