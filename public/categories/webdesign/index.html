                This article was originally published on Mozilla’s Hacks Blog.
As a front-end developer at Mozilla, I end up working on big sites that have been around for a long time. There are a lot of interesting challenges when working with legacy code at a large scale, but rebuilding from scratch usually isn’t an option.
The View Source Conference website, on the other hand, is a small site. So when we decided to move away from WordPress, we had the chance to start fresh.

                This article was originally published on Mozilla&rsquo;s Hacks Blog.
Kuma, the code that produces the MDN site, is a weird mix of the old and the new. MDN turned ten in 2015 and there’s still code and content around from those very first days. When I sat down to start coding the current redesign, the first thing I did was remove the last few traces of the last redesign. In contrast, we have a cutting-edge audience: 92% of our users have a browser with CSS grid support!

We enabled HTTP/2 on MDN&rsquo;s CDN.
We didn&rsquo;t do anything to optimize for HTTP/2, we just enabled it.
We&rsquo;re seeing performance improvements.
You don&rsquo;t have to get ready before you start using HTTP/2 While doing research to see if turning it on without doing any optimizations was a good idea I read things like:
 &ldquo;It also means that all of those HTTP1 performance techniques are harmful.

Many of us use Google Analytics (GA) or similar third-party services to keep track of how people interact with our websites; telling us things like when people visit and what they click. This data can help us make important decisions, such as when to schedule maintenance or if a feature can be removed.
Because these services are installed on multiple websites these third-parties can collect a lot of information about people as they move around the internet.

Once, as part of a “getting to know you” activity at summer camp, I played a game where I was given a drawing and another camper was given a paper and pencil. Without her seeing the drawing, and without me seeing her paper, I had to try to get her to draw what I could see.

I&rsquo;m really doing it because there&rsquo;s stuff I want to do.

                Print styles are the original responsive designs. Using media queries we pare down the content, focus on readability, and design with different device capabilities in mind but when was the last time you took a good look at your print styles?
Yes, people still print web pages. Extrapolating from these numbers about 10,000 pages are printed from bcit.ca every month. The print experience is an important part of a good site and relying on your screen styles to print properly is foolish:

On the bright side it works on any background colour and is a little transparent which is neat. And it&rsquo;s way faster to adjust the colour scheme than an image file would be.

I have some bad news and a fix (I hesitate to call it good news).
HTML5 introduces a way for us to include &lt;style&gt; elements on the page, we just need to give them an attribute of scoped. So, for example, if you have an SSI included widget you can include the styles in the widget file instead of trying to devise a way to add them to the head.

                Twitter is an amazing tool to catch a glimpse of the collective consciousness. I&rsquo;ve seen it during the Olympics and I&rsquo;ve been apart of it at conferences like An Event Apart. Jeremy Keith once said that Twitter was the closest he&rsquo;d ever come to feeling as though he&rsquo;s jacked into the Matrix.
Most of us use Twitter to keep in touch with people we know and keep up with things we care about.

 Desaturating the colours in the style sheet. Desaturating every image on the site, that&rsquo;s right, all of them.

                I hate form styling on the best of days. This is a good example of why:
Firefox&rsquo;s buttons are wider than IE&rsquo;s or Webkit&rsquo;s. Why? This little gem in the browser&rsquo;s style sheets:
button::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&quot;reset&quot;]::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&quot;button&quot;]::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&quot;submit&quot;]::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&quot;file&quot;] &gt; input[type=&quot;button&quot;]::-moz-focus-inner { padding: 0px 2px 0px 2px; }  That&rsquo;s right, it&rsquo;s 4px wider. Thank you FireFox.
Fortunately, we can fix it!
button::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&quot;reset&quot;]::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&quot;button&quot;]::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&quot;submit&quot;]::-moz-focus-inner, input[type=&quot;file&quot;] &gt; input[type=&quot;button&quot;]::-moz-focus-inner { padding: 0px; }  That was easy :)

Did you know it was possible to use vertical-align on any inline element? Did you know that first-line is an inline element?
If you&rsquo;re working on displaying the bullets at the same height, this might be the fix for you.

Some of it works in FireFox but all the cool stuff works best in webkit: here&rsquo;s as far as I got.

                Rather than doing one giant redesign and launch, at BCIT, we&rsquo;ve been doing small updates for a while now.
Take our footer for example, I got to update all of them using the CSS a few times and then we decided we wanted to mix up the HTML. Templates and applications were updated with the new code in phases. There were a few different ways the CSS for this could have been managed but I chose to have the old code co-exist with the new in the same style sheet and differentiated the two with IDs (let&rsquo;s say I called them #footer and #fatfooter).

He discovered a page in The Sessions&rsquo;s discussion form about perfect pitch had been removed from Google search results due to a copyright infringement accusation by a company that makes a product called Perfect Pitch - the page isn&rsquo;t about the product and, in fact, barely mentions it.

The spam robots helpfully check the box for you before submitting, and you can set an email filter to trash all all the responses which have it checked.

                One of my bestest friends lives in the middle of no where. High speed internet has not yet come to this island so I&rsquo;m on dial up today, which is leading to interesting discoveries.
For example, IE6 loads images in the html before it loads background images from the CSS. Very interesting.
Also, turning off the images is not that easy. I wonder how true the assertion that people with dial up turn them off is.

                This bug seems to apply to styling elements under a class or id within a link on hover. Stuff like .class a:hover span{} or #id a:hover strong{}. The solution is to define a property on the parent link .class a:hover{} that hasn&rsquo;t been declared anywhere else in your CSS, like a text indent of 0 or something.
All the work for the solution was done by Tanfa, who wrote an article on IE Pure CSS Pop Ups Bug, I just thought it was worth mentioning that this bug can be generalized to more than the CSS menus.

                Today I got two free books, Jeremy signed Bullet Proof Ajax for me and I snagged an extra Microformats cheat sheet for Brandon. All in all a success.

                One day I&rsquo;d like to be able to make the same kind of contribution to the web design world that these speakers have. Trying to find a way to do that is as intimidating as the idea of writing a Master&rsquo;s thesis. How does one come up with new ideas?
The speakers have all been excellent so far. I always need a few days to process information though so I don&rsquo;t have much to say at this point.

                I was in Winnipeg speaking at the CADE/AMTECH Conference last week. The weather was beautiful and I saw an excellent hockey game in which the Manitoba Moose (the Vancouver Canucks&rsquo; farm team) played spectacularly only to to be knocked out of the AHL playoffs in a very Canucks way (up 2-0 at the end of the first, lost 2-3 in OT).
As part of the Technology Enabled Knowledge (TEK) initiative at BCIT Danny Catt, one of the faculty, was sponsored to take a trip around South America and Antarctica studying local research and responses to sustainability and environmental issues.

                I&rsquo;ve been wanting to seriously redo some of the HTML and CSS behind the BCIT site since I came on board here almost a year ago.
Well, I get my wish. We&rsquo;re going to take some baby steps towards semantic HTML and CSS (POSH if you like) and despite my aversion to being in charge, I&rsquo;m leading the project.
As a first step I&rsquo;m trying to write a CSS coding style guide.

                <p>I thought I&rsquo;d post my summary of Web Directions North that I distributed to the department a month or so after the conference.  I&rsquo;ve been wanting to write a more technical and personal review of it but it&rsquo;s pretty clear to me that if I haven&rsquo;t done it by now, I&rsquo;m not going to get around to doing it :)</p>

                I just finished my first micoformatted page! When I was writing the information page for HOPE&rsquo;s spring dinners I coded all the dinners as events and the organizers as hcards :) I did work with Brandon to re-do the BCIT Contacts application to use microformats but he did most of the coding on that project. This is the first time I&rsquo;ve done it myself.
I didn&rsquo;t actually tell anyone at HOPE that I&rsquo;d done it that way since it doesn&rsquo;t effect the way the page looks and I figure they&rsquo;ll discover it for themselves if it&rsquo;s useful to them.

                I keep up on my favorite blogs and web comics by book marking them all in Firefox and then using the &ldquo;open all in tabs&rdquo; option that FireFox so nicely includes to open all the book marks at once. That way I can keep track of which ones I&rsquo;ve read by closing them once I&rsquo;m done :) Yeah, it&rsquo;s lazy I know.
I&rsquo;ve been wanting to have access to my bookmarks when I&rsquo;m away from my home computer (who doesn&rsquo;t) so I jumped on the del.

                One of the projects I&rsquo;ve worked on at BCIT is Catt-Trax2. The website is for Danny Catt who is traveling through South America and Antarctica exploring conservation and sustainability issues and talking to the people in those regions working with those issues daily. He&rsquo;s taking photos, video, and sound clips of this journey and blogging about his experiences. I helped architect the website and did some design and implementation work on it.

                All I did was copy the cgi file and change the file name and now it&rsquo;s not encrypting the e-mails it sends any more.
Hm.
Edit: Yup, the problem was that I changed the name.
Edit 07-03-26: I&rsquo;ve also discovered that cgi files are not encoded using windows text format so opening them in notepad and saving them again is enough to destroy all functionality.

                I am, for the most part, self taught when it comes to HTML and CSS. I&rsquo;ve take a few courses to get a piece of paper that says I can do what I say I can do but learned very little from them.
I spotted this little CSS tidbit in a presenter&rsquo;s code at the Web Directions North conference a few weeks ago and now I&rsquo;m wondering if this is the sort of thing I missed out on by being self taught:

                I&rsquo;ve been wanting a professional blog for a while now. It&rsquo;s funny how there&rsquo;s somethings you can tell complete strangers and there&rsquo;s some things you can&rsquo;t.
