            <h1>Where am I going with this?</h1>
            <p>Vivian is such a great motivator.  I&rsquo;m still sorry to see her go.</p>

<p>I just came out of a performance review where Vivian simultaneously told me what a great job I&rsquo;m doing and laid out the changes I need to make to my life to have the world laid out at my feet by the time I&rsquo;m forty.</p>

<p>She said to me that in IT there are kind of two main career paths; one which is super specialized with one specific area of technology and one that sees the big picture and manages.</p>

<p>She thinks I should, and told me I have the right skills and thought processes to, be a manager.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with where she wants me to go but she sure made me feel like I could get there if that&rsquo;s where I wanted to go :)</p>

<p>Which begs the question, where do I want to go?</p>
