            <h1>Perfect Stranger</h1>
            <p><a href="http://twitter.com/perfectstranger"><img src="http://stephaniehobson.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/perfectstranger.jpg" alt="" /></a>Twitter is an amazing tool to catch a glimpse of the collective consciousness. I&rsquo;ve seen it during the Olympics and I&rsquo;ve been apart of it at conferences like An Event Apart. <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy Keith</a> once said that Twitter was the closest he&rsquo;d ever come to feeling as though he&rsquo;s jacked into the Matrix.</p>

<p>Most of us use Twitter to keep in touch with people we know and keep up with things we care about. It makes sense, it&rsquo;s familiar and comforting but it blocks out people and ideas we disagree with and it ignores some of the most powerful potential of Twitter.</p>

<p>What are we missing by insulating ourselves with the familiar? A recent episode of <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/spark/2010/08/joel-johnson-and-jonah-lehrer-on-following-complete-strangers-on-twitter/">CBC&rsquo;s Spark discussed the benefits of following a stranger</a> with Joel Johnson who wrote a <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5586970/why-i-stalk-a-sexy-black-woman-on-twitter-and-why-you-should-too">Gizmodo article</a> on the topic.</p>

<p>Not only can it help us avoid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink">groupthink</a> but Joel mentions a study that suggests exposure to other view points can make us more creative.</p>

<p>So I had the idea to create a twitter account that will add a random tweet to my feed now and then and when I mentioned it to <a href="http://searchingfortao.org">Daniel</a> he took a few minutes and built it.</p>

<p>You should follow a <a href="http://twitter.com/perfectstranger">@perfectstranger</a> on Twitter, and let me know what you think.</p>
