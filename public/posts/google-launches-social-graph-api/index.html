            <h1>Google Launches Social Graph API</h1>
            <p>There were several speakers at WDN who spoke about open social networks, portability and consolidating friend information across applications.  I found the talks interesting and then, while we were still at the conference, Google announced a <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/socialgraph/">Social Graph API</a> aiming to do just what we&rsquo;d been talking about.</p>
