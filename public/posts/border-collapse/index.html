            <p>I am, for the most part, self taught when it comes to HTML and CSS.  I&rsquo;ve take a few courses to get a piece of paper that says I can do what I say I can do but learned very little from them.</p>

<p>I spotted this little CSS tidbit in a presenter&rsquo;s code at the <a href="http://north.webdirections.org">Web Directions North</a> conference a few weeks ago and now I&rsquo;m wondering if this is the sort of thing I missed out on by being self taught:</p>

<pre><code>table {
        border-collapse: collapse;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>There are quite a few tables I&rsquo;ve designed where this would have been very useful.</p>
