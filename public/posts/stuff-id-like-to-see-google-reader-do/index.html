            <h1>Stuff I&#39;d like to see Google Reader do</h1>
            <p>I wish I could filter my feeds like I do my email, marking the news items in my web comic feeds as read automatically and blocking (deleting? marking as read?) feeds originating at certain URLs (some of my friends have different&hellip; taste than I do&hellip; repeatedly).</p>

<p>I also wish I could share my feeds with different audiences in mind.  Right now what I share is pretty bland because my clients, friends, and family all see it.  I can&rsquo;t export only fun shared items to my Facebook profile and only web related shared items to my blog everything I share goes everywhere.</p>

<p>I used to wish I could use the handy bookmarklets to page through my items and have a handy way to share but they solved that with the notes bookmarklet.</p>

<p>That said, I live in Reader these days, I check it as much as I do my email!</p>
