            <h1>Quick spam solution for email forms</h1>
            <p>I&rsquo;ve noticed spammers tend to try to fill out your whole form before trying to submit their spam. A while ago I tried adding a simple radio button field to the form with the value &ldquo;this is probably spam&rdquo;, and then hiding it with CSS.</p>

<p>The spam robots helpfully check the box for you before submitting, and you can set an email filter to trash all all the responses which have it checked.</p>

<p>Remember to label it appropriately so your users with CSS off know what to do with it ;)</p>
