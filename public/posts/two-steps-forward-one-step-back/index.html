            <h1>Two steps forward, one step back</h1>
            <p>Tuesday I was a guest speaker at Mrs.A&rsquo;s gifted class.  She&rsquo;s teaching a group of 9-12 year olds web design and asked if I&rsquo;d come in an talk for an afternoon.</p>

<p>So I spent 30 minutes talking to them about the basics of user centred design and how the internet works.  Then I helped them trouble shoot their table based layouts and font tags.</p>
