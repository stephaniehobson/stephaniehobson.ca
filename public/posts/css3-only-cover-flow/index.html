            <h1>CSS3 only cover flow</h1>
            <p>Nothing teaches me how to do something like a project and I was trying to learn CSS3 so I tried to make a CSS only cover flow.</p>

<p>Some of it works in FireFox but all the cool stuff works best in webkit: <a href="http://stephaniehobson.ca/coverflow/#sky">here&rsquo;s as far as I got</a>.</p>

<p>Have fun with it :)</p>
