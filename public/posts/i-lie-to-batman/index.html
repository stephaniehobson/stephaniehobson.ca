<p>I was asked the other night who my favourite comic book character is and anyone who knows me would answer without hesitation: Batman. They&rsquo;d be close.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s Robin all the way.</p>

<p>Not Dick Grayson,  Jason Todd, or Tim Drake - Robin. You know, that colourful target that swings into action next to the dark knight.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4004/4194596500_688fdb15ed_o.jpg" alt="I lie to Batman" />I like the idea that Batman needs a little bit of light to balance his darkness. I like the energy, optimism, and ingenuity of a kid fighting in an adult world.</p>

<p>Who&rsquo;s your favourite?</p>
