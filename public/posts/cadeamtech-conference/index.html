        <p>I was in Winnipeg speaking at the <abbr title="Canadian Association for Distance Education">CADE</abbr>/<abbr title="Association for Media and Technology in Education in Canada">AMTECH</abbr> Conference last week.  The weather was beautiful and I saw an excellent hockey game in which the Manitoba Moose (the Vancouver Canucks&rsquo; farm team) played spectacularly only to to be knocked out of the AHL playoffs in a very Canucks way (up 2-0 at the end of the first, lost 2-3 in OT).</p>

<p>As part of the Technology Enabled Knowledge (TEK) initiative at BCIT Danny Catt, one of the faculty, was sponsored to take a trip around South America and Antarctica studying local research and responses to sustainability and environmental issues.  Throughout the journey he used blogging, digital photography, virtual lecture software, shared file storage space, and of course e-mail to keep in touch which his students and communicate with the world.</p>

<p>Terry Fuller, the instructional development coordinator that was helping Danny with the project submitted a paper to CADE to talk about &ldquo;Using the Internet to make Meaningful Global Connections in the Classroom.&ldquo;  I was involved in creating the <a href="http://blogs.bcit.ca/catttrax2/">web page and blog</a> that was the highlight of the project and Terry asked me to talk about the &ldquo;technical&rdquo; side of designing the website.</p>

<p>Rather than boring the crowd with PHP, HTML, CSS, CMS and other <abbr title="three letter acronyms">TLA</abbr>s.  I talked about the rest of the stuff that goes into the design process: user needs, site objectives, functional specifications, content requirements, information architecture, navigation design, visual design, and <a href="http://www.jjg.net/elements/pdf/elements.pdf" title="Jesse James Garrett">all that good stuff</a> but for those of you who care the site was driven by Drupal and included a XML driven flash photo gallery, a Google map mashup, and some video and audio recordings, though not as many as we&rsquo;d hoped - apparently it&rsquo;s tough to upload media files from the middle of the Amazon - who knew?</p>

<p>The project was a lot of fun and very different my usual daily duties.  I&rsquo;ll post a summary and the slides soon.</p>
