            <h1>Imperfect Pitch</h1>
            <p>There&rsquo;s been <a href="http://www.speakoutoncopyright.ca/">a lot of talk about</a> <a href="http://www.faircopyrightforcanada.ca/">copyright in Canada</a> lately since we&rsquo;ve been trying to perfect the updates the Conservatives are pitching to our outdated copyright legislation - so reading about Jeremy&rsquo;s copyright woes in his recent post <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1623/">Perfect Pitch</a> really struck a chord.</p>

<p>He discovered <a href="http://www.thesession.org/discussions/display/21250">a page in The Sessions&rsquo;s discussion form about perfect pitch</a> had been removed from Google search results due to a copyright infringement <em>accusation</em> by a company that makes a product called Perfect Pitch - the page isn&rsquo;t about the product and, in fact, barely mentions it. So there <em>wasn&rsquo;t</em> a copyright infringement but fighting it might require someone to show up in a California court room.</p>

<p>The usual method for dealing with DMCA complaints is to contact the ISP, not search engines. So why did this company without a valid complaint go to Google? Well, one goes to Google to get sites removed from search results. Maybe&hellip; search results where it is pushing down your company&rsquo;s results?</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t know, we don&rsquo;t have the full story here, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time a DMCA has been filed to remove content which isn&rsquo;t infringing on anyone&rsquo;s copyrights. <a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/10/mccain-campaign-feels-dmca-sting">It happened to political videos during the US Presidential elections</a> and it <em>scares</em> me.</p>

<p>This is a poignant example of why we need to think our new legislation through very carefully, and why I support a &ldquo;notice and notice&rdquo; system instead of the DMCA&rsquo;s &ldquo;notice and take down&rdquo; one.</p>

<p><em>UPDATE: The Perfect Pitch people contacted Jeremy with <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1624/">an explanation</a> and are attempting to reverse their submission. It was laziness, not malice, which in some ways makes it even scarier.</em></p>
