            <h1>CSS Loading Spinner</h1>
            

<p>I needed a loading spinner for a side project the other day but I was too lazy to steal someone else&rsquo;s off the internet or try to re-learn making an animated GIF so I just coded my own in CSS (CSS is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument">my hammer</a>).</p>

<p>On the bright side it works on any background colour and is a little transparent which is neat. And it&rsquo;s <em>way</em> faster to adjust the colour scheme than an image file would be.</p>

<h3 id="the-basic-idea">The basic idea</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s one <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> containing 8 <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s, styled to be little grey lozenges:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">.spinner span {
    display:block;
    height:13px;
    width:5px;
    border-radius: 2px;
    background-color:rgba(77, 77, 77,0.5);
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>In anticipation of rotating them I moved the <code>transform-origin</code> to the middle of the element and then a significant way down beneath it. Later, when I rotate the lozenges this spaces them further apart.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">    ...
    transform-origin: 50% 160%;
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>They all have a simple animation applied to them that makes them fade in and out (it has a bit of an opacity on it just for fun):</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">    ...
    animation-name: fade;
    animation-duration: 1s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    animation-direction: alternate;
    animation-fill-mode:backwards;
}

@keyframes fade {
    0% {
        background-color:rgba(77, 77, 77,0.8);
    }
    40% {
        background-color:rgba(77, 77, 77,0.8);
    }
    100% {
        background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255,0.8);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>nth-of-type</code> each lozenge is rotated 45degrees more than the last and has a delay of 250ms added to the animation on it. Unfortunately there is no easy way to do this program-magically so they have to be specified for each. Here is an example of the code for the second one:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">.spinner span:nth-of-type(2) {
    transform: rotate(45deg);
    animation-delay: -750ms;
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="starting-in-the-middle">Starting in the middle</h3>

<p>Did you know that you can provide a <em>negative</em> value for <code>animation-delay</code>? Cool, eh?!?! This means I can make it appear that the animation is beginning in the middle, otherwise the first time it&rsquo;s run it looks funny.</p>

<h3 id="placing-the-spinner">Placing the spinner</h3>

<p>I added some absolute positioning to the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s, so the origin of the transform is at the top left of their parent <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. This means the spinner fans out from the top left of the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and you can absolutely position it to exactly where you want the <em>middle</em> of the spinner.  Handy if you want to place the spinner in the middle of something, like I did.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">.spinner {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
}

.spinner span {
    position: absolute;
    top: -20px;
    left: -3px;
    ...
</code></pre>

<h3 id="changing-the-colour">Changing the colour</h3>

<p>Changing the colour is as simple as creating a new animation and applying that to your special spinner spans.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">.special .spinner span {
    animation-name: specialfade;
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="using-it">Using it</h3>

<p><a href="http://stephaniehobson.ca/loading-spinner/">Here&rsquo;s the loading spinner</a> with the <code>moz</code> and <code>webkit</code> prefixes. Of course, it only works in browsers that support animation and transforms but there&rsquo;s more and more of those these days.</p>

<p>Also, yes, totally, please use it. <a href="http://twitter.com/stephaniehobson">Tweet me</a> if you make any improvements.</p>

<h3 id="a-little-bit-more">A little bit more</h3>

<p>I got a little carried away and made a few <a href="http://stephaniehobson.ca/loading-spinner/other-styles.html">other styles</a>.</p>
