            <h1>Leave</h1>
            

<p>I&rsquo;m taking a one year leave of absence from my job at BCIT beginning June 1<sup>st</sup>, 2012.</p>

<p>Right now it kind of feels like I&rsquo;m doing this because I&rsquo;m crazy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really doing it because there&rsquo;s stuff I want to do.</p>

<p>I want to build something cool. I want to learn something new. I want to live in London. I want to live in San Francisco. I want to hang out with the dear friends who live in each city who I have been apart from for way to long. I want to get to know the friends that I&rsquo;ve made in my travels but never lived near.</p>

<p>Along the way I&rsquo;d going to have to do a bit of work. Contract/sub-contract work I can do remotely while I&rsquo;m traveling or job offers in San Francisco and London that will help me with the paperwork to work there.</p>

<p>Work that will let me do what I do really well<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup>, work that will let me do things I enjoy but don&rsquo;t do enough of<sup><a href="#two">2</a></sup>, and work that will give me a chance to learn what I don&rsquo;t do at all yet<sup><a href="#three">3</a></sup>.</p>

<ol>
<li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, brainstorming and problem solving.</li>
<li>Responsive design, user experience testing, information architecture, interface design.</li>
<li>SVG, SASS, ePub.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;m also looking for cheap places to say - friend of a friends who need house sitters or subletters, empty guest rooms and comfy couches. In London or Brighton in Aug and Sept and San Francisco or Berkeley from Oct-Dec.</p>

<p>If you have some work, a place to stay, or some advice for me I can be contacted on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/stephaniehobsonca">LinkedIn</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/stephaniehobson">Twitter</a>.</p>
