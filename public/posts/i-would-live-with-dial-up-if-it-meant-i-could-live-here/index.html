            <h1>I would live with dial up if it meant I could live here.</h1>
            <p>One of my bestest friends lives in the middle of no where.  High speed internet has not yet come to this island so I&rsquo;m on dial up today, which is leading to interesting discoveries.</p>

<p>For example, IE6 loads images in the html before it loads background images from the CSS. Very interesting.</p>

<p>Also, turning off the images is not that easy.  I wonder how true the assertion that people with dial up turn them off is.</p>

<p>Bonne Annee!</p>
