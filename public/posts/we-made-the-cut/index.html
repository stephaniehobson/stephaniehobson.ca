            <h1>We made the cut!</h1>
            <p>One of the videos we made <a href="http://stephaniehobson.ca/2007/08/10/10-seconds-of-my-15-minutes/" title="Blog post I made the other day about making gmail videos.">the other day</a> made the cut into the final <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/gmail_video.html">Gmail behind the scenes video</a>.Â  <a href="http://www.alistair.com/">Alistair</a>&rsquo;s fancy editing shows the three of us morphing between chin up bars with 1:37 left to go.</p>

<p>A second video of ours was chosen as a featured clip. If you got to the page with the  final <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/gmail_video.html">Gmail behind the scenes video</a> and scroll down to the map, our multi monitor video appears if you click the Vancouver icon.</p>
