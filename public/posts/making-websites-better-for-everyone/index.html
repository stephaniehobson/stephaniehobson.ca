            <h1>Making Websites Better for Everyone</h1>
            <p>There&rsquo;s a few different versions of my talk floating around now. I&rsquo;m really excited and humbled to hear that people have been making changes to the way the work in response to something I said.</p>

<p>The most detailed (and longest) version of my talk is available to watch on <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2014/09/02/stephanie-hobson-accessibility-with-css-making-websites-better-for-everyone/">Wordpress TV</a>.</p>

<p>My first slide deck and links to the resources I recommend are part of <a href="http://stephaniehobson.ca/2014/05/14/accessibility-with-css-making-websites-better-for-everyone/">an earlier blog post</a>.</p>

<p>In the most recent version of my talk I used a demo of a fictional hosting company&rsquo;s server status page. Follow these thinks to see the <a href="http://stephaniehobson.ca/demos/hosting_bad.html">bad</a> and <a href="http://stephaniehobson.ca/demos/hosting_good.html">good</a> examples and I encourage you to compare the two right now using some assistive technology, or at the very least, using your nose or elbow on your mouse or trackpad.</p>
