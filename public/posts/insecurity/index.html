            <h1>Insecurity</h1>
            <p>All I did was copy the cgi file and change the file name and now it&rsquo;s not encrypting the e-mails it sends any more.</p>

<p>Hm.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Yup, the problem was that I changed the name.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 07-03-26:</strong> I&rsquo;ve also discovered that cgi files are not encoded using windows text format so opening them in notepad and saving them again is enough to destroy all functionality.</p>
