            <h1>Maintaining your CSS helps maintain your site</h1>
            <p>Rather than doing one giant redesign and launch, at BCIT, we&rsquo;ve been doing small updates for a while now.</p>

<p>Take our footer for example, I got to update all of them using the CSS a few times and then we decided we wanted to mix up the HTML. Templates and applications were updated with the new code in phases. There were a few different ways the CSS for this could have been managed but I chose to have the old code co-exist with the new in the same style sheet and differentiated the two with IDs (let&rsquo;s say I called them #footer and #fatfooter).</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve phased in #fatfooter slowly across the 46ish templates, 3 CMSs, and only Brandon knows how many applications with their own code that make up our website.</p>

<p>We should be done now and, unintentionally, I made it easy for us to check. A quick search of the server for id=&ldquo;footer&rdquo; turned up all the stragglers.</p>

<p>Some of the stragglers had been neglected for a while and turned out to need more than just a new footer&hellip;</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s languishing in your code that you can delete?</p>
