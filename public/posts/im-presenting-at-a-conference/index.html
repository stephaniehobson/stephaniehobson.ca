        <p>One of the projects I&rsquo;ve worked on at BCIT is <a href="http://blogs.bcit.ca/catttrax2/" title="Catt -Trax2: The Antarctic to the Amazon.">Catt-Trax2</a>.  The website is for Danny Catt who is traveling through South America and Antarctica exploring conservation and sustainability issues and talking to the people in those regions working with those issues daily.  He&rsquo;s taking photos, video, and sound clips of this journey and blogging about his experiences.  I helped architect the website and did some design and implementation work on it. We have fun stuff like a Google Maps mashup showing his route too.</p>

<p>The project manager for the project is an Instructional Development Coordinator named Terry Fuller who has done an excellent job pushing the team to give their most while restraining Danny&rsquo;s overwhelming enthusiasm to keep the project in scope.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s asked me to co-present about the project at a conference for distance educators that is happening in Winnipeg in May. I&rsquo;ve applied for funding to go with her.  <a href="http://cade-aced.ca/conferences/2007/viewSession.php?presenterID=119">Our names</a> are already on the website, so I hope I get the funding :)</p>
