            <h1>No, wait, I wasn&#39;t done reading that!</h1>
            <p>When I went on vacation a few weeks ago I got a little behind on my RSS feeds.  I&rsquo;d manage to whittle it down from almost 200 unread articles to about 40 over the course of the month, while keeping up with all the new articles, and I was feeling pretty good about it when I went to switch my view from new items to all items and hit &ldquo;mark all as read&rdquo; instead.</p>

<p>Noooooooooooo!</p>

<p>This is an unrecoverable error. There&rsquo;s no undo and there&rsquo;s no way to mark an article more than a certain number of days (30?) old as unread again even if I open it individually.</p>

<p>A quick visit to the Reader group confirms that I&rsquo;m not crazy and I&rsquo;m not the only one who has done this.</p>

<p>What gives Google?</p>
