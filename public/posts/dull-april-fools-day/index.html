            <h1>A Dull April Fool&#39;s Day</h1>
            <p>There was a rash of black and white April Fool&rsquo;s Day sites this year. We weren&rsquo;t the only ones to do it but I think we did it best, if I do say so myself. There were three parts to our little switch and it wouldn&rsquo;t have been the same without any of them:</p>

<ul>
<li>Desaturating the colours in the style sheet.</li>
<li>Desaturating every image on the site, that&rsquo;s right, all of them.</li>
<li>Authentic content.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Desaturating the colours in the stylesheet.</strong></p>

<p>I captured the colours in the stylesheet using the Web Developer Extension in FireFox. Information &gt; View Color Information produces a list of all the colours used in the styles and their hex codes. I took a screen shot of that and then desaturated it in Photoshop by adding a desaturation layer.</p>

<p>Once I had the desaturated colours I did a find and replace for the original hex codes in the style sheet, sampling the new hex codes from my Photoshop document.</p>

<p><strong>Desaturating all the images.</strong></p>

<p>All the images? Yep, all the images.</p>

<p>For this I tried out a couple different javascript libraries but ultimately went with <a href="http://mezzoblue.github.com/PaintbrushJS/demo/">PaintBrushJS</a> by <a href="http://mezzoblue.com">Dave Shea</a> because it was the only one that could handle background images and didn&rsquo;t add any extra elements to the page. PaintBrushJS uses a combination of javascript and canvas to alter the images.</p>

<p>For backwards compatibility I manually converted all the header and footer assets to black and white, this also meant I could restrict the desaturating javascript to running on just the content and leaving these pieces alone, taking a bit of a load off the client.</p>

<p>I actually had the easiest time getting it to work in IE&hellip; there&rsquo;s a filter. I wouldn&rsquo;t have used an evil evil filter if it hadn&rsquo;t just been for half of one day but it was so I did.</p>

<p>I think this kind of photo manipulation has a place in web design since it means we can keep the unaltered versions of files and change their rendering when we change the theme, that&rsquo;s pretty powerful.</p>

<p><strong>Authentic Content.</strong></p>

<p>We were lucky that the <a href="http://www.bcit.ca/archives/">BCIT Archives</a> have begun digitizing much of their collection. We got a great deal of source material from the <a href="http://archives.bcit.ca/PDFs/1968_1969BCIT_PTCalendar.pdf">1968-69 Program and Course Catalogue</a>. We listed courses like Punch Card Systems and Fortran VI for the day - both sold out of course.</p>

<p>Nope, the logo wasn&rsquo;t a Star Trek knock off, that&rsquo;s what the future looked like in the 60s and both BCIT and Star Trek ran with it.</p>

<p>The content about campus events came from copies of the student news paper from the same era. My favourite of the new stories was about how BCIT was getting its <em>second</em> computer.</p>

<p><strong>It was a lot of fun and I&rsquo;m glad we work at the kind of place that was keen to let us do it.</strong></p>
