      <description>Note: If you&amp;rsquo;re following me because you&amp;rsquo;re a code geek, like I am, and you want only my web design related feed and posts they have their own category now.
I was asked the other night who my favourite comic book character is and anyone who knows me would answer without hesitation: Batman. They&amp;rsquo;d be close.
It&amp;rsquo;s Robin all the way.
Not Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, or Tim Drake - Robin.</description>

      <description>Rather than doing one giant redesign and launch, at BCIT, we&amp;rsquo;ve been doing small updates for a while now.
Take our footer for example, I got to update all of them using the CSS a few times and then we decided we wanted to mix up the HTML. Templates and applications were updated with the new code in phases. There were a few different ways the CSS for this could have been managed but I chose to have the old code co-exist with the new in the same style sheet and differentiated the two with IDs (let&amp;rsquo;s say I called them #footer and #fatfooter).</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of talk about copyright in Canada lately since we&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to perfect the updates the Conservatives are pitching to our outdated copyright legislation - so reading about Jeremy&amp;rsquo;s copyright woes in his recent post Perfect Pitch really struck a chord.
He discovered a page in The Sessions&amp;rsquo;s discussion form about perfect pitch had been removed from Google search results due to a copyright infringement accusation by a company that makes a product called Perfect Pitch - the page isn&amp;rsquo;t about the product and, in fact, barely mentions it.</description>
