      <description>Know how IE and FF display list-style-image bullets at two different heights and it drives us all nuts?
Did you know it was possible to use vertical-align on any inline element? Did you know that first-line is an inline element?
If you&amp;rsquo;re working on displaying the bullets at the same height, this might be the fix for you.</description>

      <description>Nothing teaches me how to do something like a project and I was trying to learn CSS3 so I tried to make a CSS only cover flow.
Some of it works in FireFox but all the cool stuff works best in webkit: here&amp;rsquo;s as far as I got.
Have fun with it :)</description>
