      <title>Accessibility Problem with Gilder/Levin Image Replacement Method</title>

      <description>I have a friend who lives his life in low contrast. He is frequently the inspiration I need to go the extra mile and find an accessible solution to a programing quandary. A few weeks ago I had the good fortune to get to visit him and we cruised around the internet while drinking Rusty Nails so I could walk in his shoes for a bit.
His computer is set up to use one of Windows XP&amp;rsquo;s high contrast colour schemes and he also makes use of IE&amp;rsquo;s ability to override a website&amp;rsquo;s CSS.</description>

      <description>Almost a year ago now the BCIT Bookstore let Web Services know that the e-commerce application they used to manage their online sales was upgrading and asked if we&amp;rsquo;d like to help skin the new site. The department was pretty busy at the time and my manager said we didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to help out but put them in contact with me so I could direct them to the style guide and technical guidelines.</description>

      <description>I read John Resig&amp;rsquo;s article Sub-Pixel Problems in CSS a few days ago and found it to very useful information.
And then today I had an &amp;ldquo;ah-ha&amp;rsquo; moment - this this is why I hate coding flexible horizontal navigation menus.</description>

      <description>There were several speakers at WDN who spoke about open social networks, portability and consolidating friend information across applications. I found the talks interesting and then, while we were still at the conference, Google announced a Social Graph API aiming to do just what we&amp;rsquo;d been talking about.</description>
