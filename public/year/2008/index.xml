      <description>I have a friend who lives his life in low contrast. He is frequently the inspiration I need to go the extra mile and find an accessible solution to a programing quandary. A few weeks ago I had the good fortune to get to visit him and we cruised around the internet while drinking Rusty Nails so I could walk in his shoes for a bit.
His computer is set up to use one of Windows XP&amp;rsquo;s high contrast colour schemes and he also makes use of IE&amp;rsquo;s ability to override a website&amp;rsquo;s CSS.</description>

      <description>In the spirit of Jeremy Keith&amp;rsquo;s post, here&amp;rsquo;s 8 random things I see about me:
 Black queen carved like Raven. Small brass Buddha. Wind up penguin. iPhone. Microformats pocket cheat sheet. Salt. 8.5 x 11 print out of the gMail &amp;ldquo;mvelope&amp;rdquo;. Label from a Christmas present: &amp;ldquo;To Steph Love, Joel, Jim &amp;amp; Mrs. A.&amp;rdquo;  You&amp;rsquo;re it.</description>

      <description>Almost a year ago now the BCIT Bookstore let Web Services know that the e-commerce application they used to manage their online sales was upgrading and asked if we&amp;rsquo;d like to help skin the new site. The department was pretty busy at the time and my manager said we didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to help out but put them in contact with me so I could direct them to the style guide and technical guidelines.</description>

      <description>I read John Resig&amp;rsquo;s article Sub-Pixel Problems in CSS a few days ago and found it to very useful information.
And then today I had an &amp;ldquo;ah-ha&amp;rsquo; moment - this this is why I hate coding flexible horizontal navigation menus.</description>
