As a front-end developer at Mozilla, I end up working on big sites that have been around for a long time. There are a lot of interesting challenges when working with legacy code at a large scale, but rebuilding from scratch usually isn’t an option.
The View Source Conference website, on the other hand, is a small site. So when we decided to move away from WordPress, we had the chance to start fresh.

                I recently spoke at #a11yTOConf, a conference by the organizers of the regular a11yTO meet-up. The organizers put together a great line up of speakers. It was the first #a11yTOConf but I hope it won&rsquo;t be the last!
Here are my slides for Writing for Every Reader.
Resources I mentioned:  Hemingway App, the app that helps improve the readability of your content. BeeLine Reader, the browser plugin for dyslexics.

Kuma, the code that produces the MDN site, is a weird mix of the old and the new. MDN turned ten in 2015 and there’s still code and content around from those very first days. When I sat down to start coding the current redesign, the first thing I did was remove the last few traces of the last redesign. In contrast, we have a cutting-edge audience: 92% of our users have a browser with CSS grid support!

We enabled HTTP/2 on MDN&rsquo;s CDN.
We didn&rsquo;t do anything to optimize for HTTP/2, we just enabled it.
We&rsquo;re seeing performance improvements.
You don&rsquo;t have to get ready before you start using HTTP/2 While doing research to see if turning it on without doing any optimizations was a good idea I read things like:
 &ldquo;It also means that all of those HTTP1 performance techniques are harmful.

                A few weeks ago I gave my talk on displaying data tables on small screens at Cascadia Fest. Which is a super awesome 3 days conference in the Pacific North West focusing on CSS and JavaScript (Browser and Server side!)
The video of my talk has been posted:

Many of us use Google Analytics (GA) or similar third-party services to keep track of how people interact with our websites; telling us things like when people visit and what they click. This data can help us make important decisions, such as when to schedule maintenance or if a feature can be removed.
Because these services are installed on multiple websites these third-parties can collect a lot of information about people as they move around the internet.

                I was very pleased to be invited back to Style and Class to give a talk about making data tables responsive. Style and Class is a great Vancouver meet-up I can&rsquo;t recommend enough.
Here are my slides, though the video and animated gifs don&rsquo;t play :(

                In the next few weeks I&rsquo;ll be speaking at JavaScript Open Day Calgary, View Source, and JavaScript Open Day Toronto giving an updated version of Web Accessibility: Making Websites Better for Everyone.
Edit: videos have been posted for View Source and JavaScript Open Day Toronto. I&rsquo;m more on the ball for View Source but the JSOpenDay one has some demos.
In my talk I encourage people to try out different assistive technologies themselves:

                Last week, because working at Mozilla is awesome, I got to attend An Event Apart Austin, the conference put on by the A List Apart organization. It&rsquo;s consistently one of the highest quality conferences for front-end/user experience talks. I try to go every other year.
The conference was great and the organizers did a good job making the speakers accessible, sitting them with us at lunch and keeping them around for the mixer.
